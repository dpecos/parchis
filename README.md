# PARCHIS

## WTF is this??

## How do I run this ancient piece of ...?

In order to run / compile this programm, I've got the best results with DosBos and installing the original QuickBasic that I used to code it.

## Is it possible to even edit it?

Yes, but probably keeping the same file encoding that MS-DOS used is important:

- MS-DOS file encoding was named "DOS latin1"
- In Visual Studio Code, selecting "DOS (CP 437)" almost perfectly loaded all the code.
